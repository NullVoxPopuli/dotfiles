# We need to pad one or both of the dimensions to make the dimensions

# NOTES: https://blog.addpipe.com/converting-webm-to-mp4-with-ffmpeg/

# All MP4 files contain a moov atom. 
# The moov atom contains information about the length of the video. 
# If itâ€™s at the beginning it immediately enables a streaming video player to play and scrub the MP4 file. 
# By default FFmpeg places the moov atom at the end of the MP4 file.

# To ensure the highest compatibility with older iOS or Android devices you will need to use certain encoding profiles and levels. 
# For example a video encoded with the High Profile and Level 4.2 will work on iPhone 5S and newer but not on older iOS devices.
